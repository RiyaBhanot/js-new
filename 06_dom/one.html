<!--The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a
document on the web
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs
can change the document structure, style, and content.
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. 

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the structure of a web page as a hierarchical tree of objects, making it possible for programming languages like 
JavaScript to manipulate, access, and modify the content, structure, and style of a website dynamically.

Key Features of the DOM:
Tree Structure:

The DOM organizes an HTML document as a tree of nodes.
Each element, attribute, and piece of text is a node in this tree.

Dynamic Interaction:

You can use JavaScript to interact with the DOM in real time, allowing for dynamic updates to the page without needing a full reload.
Manipulation:

Access: 
Find elements using methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), etc.
Modify: 
Change the content, attributes, or style using properties like innerHTML, setAttribute(), or style.
Create/Delete: Add or remove nodes dynamically using methods like createElement(), appendChild(), or removeChild().
Event Handling:

The DOM supports event-driven programming, enabling developers to respond to user actions like clicks, keypresses, or hover effects.
Real-Life Analogy:
Think of the DOM as the blueprint of a house. The HTML is like the original design (static content), 
but with the DOM, you can rearrange furniture, paint walls, or even add new rooms (dynamic changes) without rebuilding the entire house.
 JavaScript acts as the toolset that helps you make these changes in real-time.
